NOTES

1. PACKAGES:-
    containers or folders of group of classes, interfaces or sub-packages. It means defining the module in Java.
    Classes within a package can share their data members and member methods using the default access specifier.
    Provides access protection.
    It can be of 2 types: (1) PDP/SDP [java.lang], (2) UDP [package global]

2. STATIC:-
    no object creation is needed. Direct access using class name. It can be accessed before creating any object of the
    class and without referencing to that object. static method can only access static data. It only runs once when the
    first object is created (instantiation). Resolved during compile time because they do not need to deal with objects.
    That's why the main method is always declared to be static.
