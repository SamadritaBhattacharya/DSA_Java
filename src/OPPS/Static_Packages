NOTES

1. PACKAGES:-
    containers or folders of group of classes, interfaces or sub-packages. It means defining the module in Java.
    Classes within a package can share their data members and member methods using the default access specifier.
    Provides access protection.
    It can be of 2 types: (1) PDP/SDP [java.lang], (2) UDP [package global]

2. STATIC:-
    no object creation is needed. Direct access using class name. It can be accessed before creating any object of
    the class and without referencing to that object. static method can only access static data. It only runs once
    when the first object is created (instantiation). Resolved during compile time because they do not need to deal
    with objects.That's why the main method is always declared to be static.

3. STATIC VARIABLES:-
    The term static must be mentioned. It shares only one single cpy of value for the whole class and shared by the
    objects of that class which remains constant throughout the program.
    They are also known as Class Variables as they can be accessed directly using the classname.
    Static methods can access only static variables. They are resolved during compile time.

4. INSTANCE VARIABLES:-
    It shares different values for each objects of its class.
    They are also known as non-static variables.
    Instance methods can access both static as well as non-static members.


5. SINGLETON CLASSES:
    creates only one object. That means no constructors can be used.
    So, we make the constructor private, as constructor creates objects and are called during
     the object creation of class.
